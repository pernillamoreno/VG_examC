# VG_examC

Write a C program to do some operations on this matrix:
 * 1. Make a function to fill the matrix with random even, unique numbers, in the range of min and max.
 * 2. Make a function to print the matrix to the terminal.
 * 3.   Make a function to calculate sum of elements in each row of the matrix and store the result in an
 *      element of an array passed to the function. 
 * The function shall calculate sum for all rows.
 * 4.   Make a function to calculate sum of elements in each column of the matrix and store the result
 * in an element of an array passed to the function. 
 * The function shall calculate sum for all columns.
 * 5.   In the program:     Ask the user to enter the array dimensions (R and C)
 * Make a J x K array and fill it with random, even unique numbers in the range of 10 and 1000.

   
 *VG: You must create a header file for the module and describe it well using the doxygen format.
You must create in_matrix function to check if the even value that will be randomly generated is in 
matrix or it is a new random value, and this function shall be called inside fillMatrix  function  
to fill the matrix with even, random, unique values.
